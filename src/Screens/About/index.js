                  I'm a freelance web developer from the Philippines who 
                  is passionate about building front-end WordPress websites 
                  and responsive websites. I can provide you with custom 
                  WordPress websites and themes, as well as dynamic websites 
                  or dynamic landing pages. I would love to help you if you 
                  need some changes made to your current WordPress website. 
                  Some of the tools I use are HTML, CSS, Javascript, and WordPress. 
                  My previous experience in developing a website, plugin integration, 
                  and educational attainment as an IT professional will help me 
                  provide you with a positive experience and a website that will 
                  positively impact your business.
